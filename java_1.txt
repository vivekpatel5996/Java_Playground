JAVA is ...
SECURED because it uses it's own runtime platform while other languages such as C,C++ uses OS as platform.
Platform independent because once byte code is converted by compiler it can be used on any platform like LINUX,Windows etc.
Portable because we can take byte code at anywhere with us.
Distributed because we can create distributed application using RMI,EJB.
Multi threaded so we can execute one or more programme on each thread.
objects stored in Heap memory.It references stored in stack.

JVM executes bytecode.
JVM,JDK,JRE are based on platform differ to each OS.

JRE is physically exists.
It's implementation of JVM.
It contains set of libraries.

JDK is development kit.It contains tools and JRE.

JIT complies the same type of byte code which has same functionality at same time.

JAVA uses unicode system.

Polymorphism can be achieved using overloading and overriding.

Instance variable get memory at runtime not compile time.

----------------CONSTRUCTOR-----------------------------

constructor is one type of method.
If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default constructor.
Default constructor provides the default values to the object like 0, null etc. depending on the type.
Constructor overloading is a technique in Java in which a class can have any number of constructors that differ in parameter lists.
Difference between constructor and method https://www.javatpoint.com/constructor
Constructor returns current class instance. 
You can perform any operation in the constructor as you perform in the method.

----------------GLIMPSE---------------------------------

Two class with main method is possible.But it's depend on which class first execute.
 You can have any number of main methods in a class by method overloading. But JVM calls main() method which receives string array as arguments only.
----------------STATIC KEYWORD-------------------

The static keyword in java is used for memory management mainly.
Java static property is shared to all objects. like clg name of students,company name of all employee.
A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.

------------------------------STATIC BLOCK------------------------
static block executed at first before main method is loading.
it is used for initialize static data member.
Without main() method we can execute java program but not in latest versions.

-----------------------------THIS-------------------------

'this' keyword.
It is used for instance variable of current class.
To call current class method.
To call current class constructor from ANOTHER CONSTRUCTOR.Call to this() must be the first statement in constructor.
To pass current class object in method.e.g method(this)
this is non static variable. 
https://www.javatpoint.com/this-keyword Check real use of this().

------------------------------INHERITANCE-------------------------------

IS-A relationship.
When we want to reuse methods from existing class then INHERITANCE.
For overriding,It is used.

Three type of INHERITANCE. Single,Multilevel,Hierarchical.
Multiple INHERITANCE is not supported in java.

-----------------------------AGGREGATION-----------------------------

HAS-A relationship.

------------------------------OVERLOADING------------------------

It can be done in two ways.
1) passing more parameters.
2) changes parameter types.

We can't change method return type.It must be same.

Example:Adder is  method where the number of arguments may be vary.

--------------------------OVERRIDING-------------------------

--------------------------COVARIENT RETURN TYPE---------------

In this subclass's override method has return type as a subtype of parent's return type.

---------------------------SUPER------------------
when we create subclass's object implicitly parent class object is created.

super can be use to reference immediate parent class.
super can be used to call parent class method.
super() can be used to invoke parent class constructor.

Super() and this() in child class constructor must be the first statement.

--------------------INITIALIZER BLOCK--------------------------------

It's use to perform operation while creating objects.
While runtime initializer block is placed after 'super()' in constructor.

--------------------FINAL KEYWORD-------------------

It is used for variable.method and class.
Once Final variable is declared we can't change the variable value.
Once Final method is created we can't override it.
Once class is with Final we can inherited it.

We can't override final method but surely inherit it.
We can make uninitialized final variable but then after it can be initialize in only in constructor.

static uninitialized variable can be initialize only in static block.

constructor can't be final because we can't inherit so it's meaningless to declare as final.


----------------------Runtime Polymorphism-------------------

single action in many ways.
Runtime and compile time polymorphism.
It can achieved in two ways. Overloading and overriding.

Upcasting:::::Superclass reference and subclass object.

We can override method not the data members for Runtime polymorphism.



----------------------MultiThreading--------------------------

Synchronization method,block
Static synchronization method  is used for  synchronization on class not on object.
Deadlock means when two threads are waiting for each other to use shared resouce.

For Interthread comunication wait(),notify(),notifyAll().
When we call wait() method on thread which has acquired lock of monitor on shared object,It goes in wait state.It should be called from Synchronization block,method.
When other thread which has lock call notify() method then Thread scheduler takes any thread from which are in wait() states.
NotifyAll() for all the threads.
Give example of bank.


Race condition occurs when two threads try to update shared data at same time.
Tell him about check and act problem due to race condition.


Why wait() and notify() from synchronized block?
To resolve race condition.Give example of producer and consumer.
http://javarevisited.blogspot.in/2011/05/wait-notify-and-notifyall-in-java.html#axzz4qhUEipoC


When to use notify() and when to notifyAll()?
If we know in waiting pool the threads are waiting on same condition so even  though we call notifyAll() at the end only one thread will get benifit
of lock so why should we waste CPU cycles by calling notifyAll().
http://javarevisited.blogspot.in/2012/10/difference-between-notify-and-notifyall-java-example.html#axzz4qhUEipoC

What is deadlock?Four reason for deadlock.
Deadlock means when two or more threads waiting for each other to release the lock on shared resource.So,at the end it takes infinite time.
Mutual exclusion,Hold and Wait,No premption,Circular wait.

How to avoid it?
To avoid we have to give lock on shared resource in specific order.Try to avoid circular wait.

What is livelock?
Livelock means threads are constantly changing their states but no option for progress.
Give example of narrow corrider.



Hashset internally calls HashMap methods to add elements.


To comapare multidimensional array use Arrays.deepEquals(array1,array2) method.
For one dimensional only Arrays.equals(arr1,arr2) method.
